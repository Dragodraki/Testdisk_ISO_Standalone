# Testdisk_ISO_Standalone
Allows to boot pure Testdisk-DOS - 2 MB Image

Testdisk is a reliant software to recover lost partitions or try to repair its table when boot errors appear (if not encrypted or depth erased).
Version 7.1 seeems to be the latest (and last) release from 2019. The publisher provided it as windows app (.exe) and part of other images like Cygwin.
But he never bothered to offer a direct ISO-image without the unnecessary elements.

Here you go with Testdisk 7.1 as 2 megabyte size ISO file:
a) For USB: You need an empty flash drive and a tool like "Rufus" or "Easy2Boot" to get it to work on a USB.
b) For CD (DVD/BD): You need a empty writable disc, a data-disc-drive and a tool like "ImgDrive" or "CDBurnerXP" to burn it.

-> Put the disc/flash in yuur pc, disable secure boot in bios (if enabled) and press boot keyboard key (mostly F11/F12/ESC) to boot it. Press ENTER when asked whether you'l like to continue - testdisk is loaded.
